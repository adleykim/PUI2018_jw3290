## CitiBike Review, by Pablo Mandiola (pmb434)

### Hypothesis formulation

1. The hypothesis lacks a significance level, which is important to define before doing the experiment.

2. I would suggest to use proportions instead of the absolute number, as it is easier to perform a comparison between different samples.

3. Because the underlying data records are trips, it can't really answer if there are more female or male subscribers. What it can answer is if there are more female subscribers using citibike in a given month than male subscribers.

Taking all three points into account, I would suggest to slightly modify the null and alernative hypothesis. For example, keeping the initial idea it could be something on the lines:

* $H_0$: The proportion of female riders who are subscribers is the same or higher than the proportion of male riders who are subscribers, with  significance level 0.05.

* $H_1$: The proportion of female riders who are subscribers is lower than the proportion of male riders who are subscribers.

### Data assessment

The data provided has the appropriate features to answer the question, as only the variables Gender and User Type are needed. If the test is to be done on the proportion instead of the absolute number, the same data is needed but it just has to be normalized before performing the test.

### Statistical test suggestion

For this case, I suggest to use a Z-test to compare the difference between proportions in two samples.
